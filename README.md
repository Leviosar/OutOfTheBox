# Out Of The Box! (Oob)

A hybrid app to expand the limits of education.


Hello, i'm a brazilian 17 years old student and this project has been developed as a course conclusion paper, many of the documentation are for burocracy purposes only and i'm trying my best to implement it all.


## New year, new code, new challenges

Since I started Oob, my main goal has always been to open new horizons to educators and students. At this moment i'm only achieving half of my goal, the students. 2019 just got here and i think we can make more on this year, big changes are coming to this project and i hope it's for good. Basically, i'm aiming to:

- Migrate the code to new (kinda) technologies i'm learning. I want to use Angular or Vue.js in the front end and Laravel on the back end. I'll always love Vanilla but it's time to say goodbye.
- Start a hole new module where educators can build experiences and teach their knowledges globally.
- Create a community of educators and developers to help me on this path

Well, how i said in the title, new challenges are arriving all the time and i'm ready to face them with courage and coffee.

## Before we start

The idea came out of a conversation with a friend who was studying the Explorable Explanations movement for his own paper and introduced me to Victor's Bret Work. At first i loved all the philosophy of the movement and it kept me wondering about why the major public of the EE movement was and still are teachers. Why students aren't so close to those wonderful ideas? Well, they don't even know about it.

So that's why i'm here, i want to show the students a new way of learning (despite the fact that it isn't new at all) and for me the best form to do that is a mobile app. To build this i had many great inspirations:

- Of course, Victor's Bret work on Explorable Explanations 
- The german youtube channel Kurzgesagt
- A lot of brazilian youtube science channels like Nerdologia, CiÃªncia Todo Dia and Primata Falante.

With all this explained and credits given, its time to really show what i'm doing

## Talk is cheap, show me the code

I decided to go for a hybrid app because i really suck on Java or Kotlin and a hybrid app will certainly fulfill my needs. The whole application is based on some stuff called "experiences", that's how i wanna people to learn with my app, experiencing the content on their own way. Sadly for now we have a big barrier, the only language available is brazilian portuguese but i definitely have plans to exporting it to english in the future. 

The experiences are spread on five areas: math, chemistry, phisics, biology and computer programming. i'm using as foundation the high school curriculum of Brazil to elaborate the experiences and at this point i've already made 4 of them and im planning to make a apk build around this week so you can play them (if you know portuguese of course).

For now that's all, any doubts you can contact me here or on @joaocampo3 on Twitter, i will write more about the project the soon i have the time, goodbye.


## Project setup

### Clone it, fork it, code it, push it.

Anyone with will to help is welcome to clone this repository, check the issues section or just implement a new functionality, submit as a pull request and we'll check you code.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Leviosar/OutOfTheBox
```

If you're not used to package manager there's nothing to worry about, just read [this article] (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/javascript-package-managers-101-9afd926add0a) and get started with them. On this project i'm using npm so after you clone the repo, some dependencies are needed to make the project really work. Go to the project/oob folder, open a new terminal window and type

```
$ npm install
```

The project contains Angular, and this comes with a LOT of dependecies, so it can take a while to download and extract it all
